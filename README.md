DATA SCIENCE DRIVEN SOLUTION TO IDENTIFY 
THE RELATIONSHIP OF ATTRITION OF EMPLOYEES 
WITH DEMOGRAPHICS

Description:
Attrition of employees is a significant concern for most 
companies worldwide because it reduces the workforce through employee turnover, retirement, 
and employee burnout, which can result in a loss of knowledge, skills, and productivity. 
The aim of this study is to enhance organizational productivity by developing a predictive model 
that accurately predict the prominent factor affect for employee attrition.

This research project delves deep into the realm of workforce dynamics, specifically focusing on predicting employee attrition rates using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging a suite of tools including Google Colab, Excel, Power BI, and Google Drive, we collaboratively address challenges such as limited datasets and privacy concerns.

Methodology:
We employ a variety of machine learning models, including Random Forest Classification and Gaussian Naive Bayes, which are meticulously refined through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques.

Key Features:
Several key attributes have been identified as influential in predicting attrition rates:
